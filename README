-- feature 
-forced
join the db (starting page)
create and connect to an account with a hashed password in the db

-options 
1) pokemenon allow you to see the pokemenon in the game to 
- pick the one you want to play 
- go see more detail (we recomand swinub since it has the highest attack move ice fang) you can also pick the starting pokemenon from here
2) spell allows you to see all spell in the game
- allow you to see details of the spell
- allow you to see a list of pokemenon with a specific spell and pick it has a starter going to see the detail and then going back will remove the filter
3) play allows you to play the game (the enemy health is to show that it increase with the score)
it has a score and the option to use each spell however there is no balance whatsoever and doing any other move than the highest damage one is entirely pointless
